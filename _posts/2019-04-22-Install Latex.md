### I. How to setup environment?
First of all, LaTeX needs to install both Texlive and TexEditor. And both are available on Windows, Linux(Ubuntu) and MacOS. I would recommend you to install the full TeXLive (contain every package, libraries ~ about 3.6GB in size).

#### 1. Install Texlive-full

To install Texlive-full on Ubuntu, use:
```console
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install texlive-full
```

and for MacOS, download MacTex (replace TexLive) [at here](https://tug.org/mactex/downloading.html). 

#### 2. Install TexEditor
LaTeX has some common Editor as: TexStudio, TeXMaker.

To install TexStudio on Ubuntu, use:
